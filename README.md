# WFSB ("What Firefox Should've Been")
## About
This is a `user.js` script which improves Mozilla Firefox based on my preferences.
Firefox used to be a great browser, but the company behind it started adding more and more bloat.
## Recommendations to go along with it
 * Mozilla Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release)
 * [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
## Installation
 1. Download the `user.js` (obviously)
 2. In your Firefox browser, click [this link](about:support)
 3. Once you're on the page, click on "Open folder" next to "Profile Folder"
 4. Then, drag the script into the folder that just appeared
 5. Restart Firefox
